# Expressive Interfaces: Voice

Pedro Oliveira  
NYU ITP, Spring 2015  
WED 6:30-9:00pm (01/24 - 03/07)   

## Overview

Today we no longer solely communicate with computers through a graphical user interface. As a consequence of the internet leaving the flat screen, alternative forms of interaction are increasingly becoming more ubiquitous. Designing for these new connected devices requires a different approach. From HAL 9000 to Amazon Alexa, this class presents an overview of methods, technologies and design challenges that are required to build Voice User Interfaces - VUI. Over the course of the semester, students will appropriate existing technologies, analyze examples of Voice Interfaces (in sci-fi, popular culture, art installations, connected devices), and develop their own custom solutions and design systems.
